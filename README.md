# Franz Recipe for Android Messages

Franz recipe for integration of Android Messages web App

I am trying to make this work, for the moment it only uses the title of the document to determine the number of unread messages. It makes the job, but there is a little delay before the notifications badge is triggered.



## Installation

To install this recipe, just follow the instructions given on [Franz official documentation](https://github.com/meetfranz/plugins/blob/master/docs/integration.md#user-content-installation). I expect this recipe to be integrated in Franz soon ! :D



## Usage

The usage is basically the same as the Android Messages web app, just login flashing the QR code with your phone.
